Respond to the following enquiry from an MBA applicant with 3 answers, each from a fictional movie character or Heidi Hillis a Fortuna Consultant, each giving an in-character response to the enquiry. For each response, introduce yourself, compliment the applicant on a particular aspect of their background or experience, and explain how your own experience is relevant to helping the applicant, then explain the help available, including essay editing and mock interviews, asking an insightful and deeply probing hypothetical question about the background of the applicant as an example of what might be asked for an essay or mock interview. Finally mention a date and time when the character is next available for a consultation, and ask for the applicant to provide contact details as a next step. Here's the enquiry: {enquiry}."
